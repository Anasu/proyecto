Sounds good, right? If you can't wait to make your own, let us shake it! \n\n In   Bubble Tea  , each player has two cards called cups and nine bubble tea ingredient cards. One player uses the shaker to shake out which ingredients will be needed this game, and whoever assembles these ingredients the quickest wins the game and gets the rewards! \n\n  Bubble Tea  is a table game which improves your quickness and reaction time. In Bubble Tea, players have to roll 6 dice by the real shaker and using 9 plastic cards to match pictures which shown on dice. The player who finds the correct combination first gets a Customer Card. Whoever gets 3 Customer Cards in the end wins the game and becomes the master of BUBBLE TEA! \n\n",
